what programming means to me:-
                         I was always facinated by magic happening behind the screens. I got to know that the magic was due to softwares , programs written by programmers. So programming is a tool for me to create that magic, to solve a problem through softwares.




Goals for this internship and what i hope to learn:-

I am learning from youtube and documentations,  learing from online is good for exposure but i donot know if things i learned is good enough and applied in real world applications. I hope to learn the best practises applied in real world applications and make myself ready to enter workforce.
