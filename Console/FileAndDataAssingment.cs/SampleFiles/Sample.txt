An intern is a student or recent graduate who works in a temporary position with a focus on on-the-job training 
rather than just employment. Internships are designed to provide practical work experience in a specific field,
helping individuals develop skills and gain a better understanding of a particular industry. They can be paid 
or unpaid and can last anywhere from a few weeks to a full year.
